#  Shell Scripting For DevOps

This repository is a structured collection of shell scripting exercises I completed while learning **Shell Scripting for DevOps** from the [TrainWithShubham YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@trainwithshubham).  
It documents my day-wise progress across 6 days, focusing on real-world use cases in DevOps automation, scripting, and infrastructure management.
