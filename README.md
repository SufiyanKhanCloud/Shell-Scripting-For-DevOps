# 🧾 Shell Scripting For DevOps

This repository contains my hands-on scripting journey while learning **Shell Scripting for DevOps** from TrainwithShubham YouTube series. I structured the content day-wise as I progressed through the course, creating scripts to automate tasks, deploy apps, and perform system-level operations.
